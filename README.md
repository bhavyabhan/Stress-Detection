# Stress-Detection: Integrating Machine Learning, Deep Learning Mechanism with BERT for Comprehensive Stress Analysis
Project objectives:

1. Develop a framework for integrating machine learning models with BERT to enhance stress analysis in textual data.
2. Implement a pipeline for integrating deep learning models with BERT to improve the accuracy and robustness of stress detection systems.

Project Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing: The preprocessing steps involve converting text to lowercase,
tokenization, punctuation removal, and stop word elimination to refine and enhance the
quality of textual data for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks
2. Tokenization: The tokenizer used in the preprocessing step is the BERT
tokenizer, specifically initialized from the 'bert-large-uncased' model, which
is a part of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) architecture, known for its effectiveness in capturing
contextual information from textual data. Also, Vectorize text using TF-IDF.
3. BERT MODEL:
BERT uses a Transformer encoder to process each token of input text in the
context of all tokens before and after. This bidirectional nature allows BERT to
consider the full context of a word by analyzing both its preceding and
subsequent words in a sequence.
4. Model Training:
  a. Machine Learning Models
Machine learning models utilized in this study encompass Logistic
Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive
Bayes.
  b. Deep Learning Models
Deep learning models employed include various neural network
architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and
Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which excel in capturing intricate patterns and
dependencies within the data for enhanced predictive performance.
